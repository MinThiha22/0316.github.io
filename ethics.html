          <p id="ethics_p">One of the primary risks associated with implementing robots in warehousing is the potential impact on workers.
            <br>While robots can automate certain tasks and improve efficiency, they may also displace human workers, leading to job losses and economic insecurity. 
            <br>This can have significant ethical implications, as it can lead to increased income inequality and social unrest. 
            <br>Thus, there is a need for investment in training and education programs that enable workers to develop the skills necessary 
            <br>to collaborate effectively with robots or transition into new roles that cannot be easily automated. 
            <br>Ensuring access to these programs is vital for maintaining workers' employability. (Hamberg & Verriet, 2012)</p>

          <h3 id="ethics">Automation and Efficiency</h3>
          <p> While robots offer automation and improved efficiency in warehousing, ethical considerations arise as these
            advancements can potentially contribute to human job losses and a widening income gap.</p>

        <section class="box-container-itemEthics">
          <h3 id="ethics">Income Equality + Social Unrest</h3>
          <p>The displacement of human workers by robots can exacerbate income inequality, leading to social unrest, which
            raises ethical questions about fairness and societal stability.</p>

      <h2 id="ethics">Summary</h2>
      <div class="box-container">
        <!-- <section class="box-container-itemChoices"> -->
          <p id="ethics_p">By considering the risks and promoting sustainability in the implementation of robots in warehousing, 
          <br>companies can achieve the benefits of increased efficiency and productivity while minimising negative impacts on people, the economy, and the environment.
          <br>However, it is essential to carefully consider and address all ethical concerns to promote a responsible integration of robotics into the workplace, 
          <br>taking into account the well-being and dignity of workers, as well as broader social implications. (Hamberg & Verriet, 2012)</p>

          <h3 id="ethics">Environmental Impacts</h3>
          <p>Implementing robots in warehousing can have both positive and negative environmental impacts. On the one hand,
            robots can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by optimising transportation routes and
            reducing the need for human-operated vehicles. However, the production and disposal of robots can also have
            significant environmental impacts, as these processes often require the use of non-renewable resources and can
            generate significant waste. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with operating robots can be
            significant, and the use of robots may increase overall energy demand.</p>
