      <p>Robots used in warehousing can take on various forms, from autonomous mobile robots to robotic arms and drones. They are equipped with advanced sensors, computer vision systems, and sophisticated algorithms that enable them to navigate complex warehouse environments, recognise and manipulate objects, and collaborate with human workers seamlessly. These robots can be programmed to perform tasks such as inventory management, order fulfilment, packing, and sorting, and many more. <br><br>However, implementing robots in warehousing poses various risks that need to be taken into account when implementing this technology into the Supply Chain Industry. While employing robots can bring significant benefits to automation in terms of efficiency and productivity, it is crucial to consider the potential impacts on sustainability, including the <u>ethical</u>, <u>economic</u> and <u>environmental</u> aspects. (Aldinhas Ferreira et al., 2017)</p>
