          <h3 id="headers_opportunities">Increased Efficiency</h3>
          <p>Robots have an ability to operate continuously 
             without rest or breaks, and can manage different tasks faster and more precise compared to humans, resulting in higher productivity and efficiency. This can lead to reduced labour costs. <br> (Mirzaei et al., 2022) </p>

        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3 id="headers_opportunities">Scalability</h3>
          <p>Robots can easily be added or removed from the warehouse in 
             response to changing demand, allowing for flexible and scalable operations.<br> (De Koster, 2018)</p>

        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3 id="headers_opportunities">Cost Savings</h3>
          <p>Robots can reduce labour costs by replacing human workers for repetitive and physically demanding tasks freeing up employees for higher-value work.<br>(De Koster, 2018) </p>

        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3 id="headers_opportunities">Improved Safety</h3>
          <p>Robots can perform dangerous tasks and work in hazardous environments, reducing the risk of workplace accidents and injuries for human workers. (De Koster, 2018)</p>

        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3 id="headers_opportunities">Enhanced Accuracy</h3>
          <p>Robots can operate with a high degree of accuracy and consistency, reducing errors and improving inventory management, production and order fulfilment, and resulting in improved overall performance. (Mirzaei et al., 2022)</p>
