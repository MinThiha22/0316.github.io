        <h2>Automation in Warehousing</h2>
        <p>Automation has changed human society, transforming various industries and revolutionising the way we work. <br> From its early roots in the Ford assembly line to the modern supply chain logistics, automation has played a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency, productivity, and overall economic growth. <br> Nowadays, automation has become even more sophisticated. In the realm of supply chain logistics, automation has improved the way products are handled, stored, and transported. <br> One notable area of advancement is warehousing. Traditionally, warehousing involved manual labour for activities such as inventory management, order fulfilment, and packaging. <br> However, with the advent of automation technologies, such as robotics warehouses have undergone a profound transformation. (Hamberg & Verriet, 2012). <br></p>
