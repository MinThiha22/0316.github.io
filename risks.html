          <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
          <p>The use of robots in warehousing may lead to job displacement for human workers. There is a big risk of unemployment and a need for re-skilling or re-training. This could have negative economic and social impacts if these workers are unable to find new employment opportunities.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
          <p>Robots connected to the internet or other networks can be vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks, potentially compromising sensitive data and operations.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>High Initial Investment</h3>
          <p>Implementing robots in a warehouse requires a significant upfront investment in both hardware and software, which may be a barrier for some businesses.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
          <p>The production and disposal of robots can have negative environmental impacts, including the use of energy and resources, and the generation of waste.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
          <p>Robots can pose a risk to human health and safety if they are not designed and implemented properly. For example, robots can cause physical harm to humans if they are not programmed to detect human presence or if they malfunction. It is important to ensure that proper safety measures are put in place to prevent such incidents.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>Maintenance / Repair</h3>
          <p>Robots require regular maintenance and repairs, which can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-item">
          <h3>Technological Dependency</h3>
          <p>The increased reliance on technology and automation can make a warehouse more vulnerable to disruptions such as power outages or system failures, which could cause significant downtime and losses.</p>
